Assignment: Weather Dashboard

Description: I created a web application that allows the user to search for weather information based on location. When a user inputs a location the application will display the current day, temperature, humidity, wind speed, uv index, and a weather icon. It will also display a five day future forecast with a weather icon, temperature value, and humidity value. The web page will display the recent searches of the user underneath the input area. 

This assignment was very difficult for me. I got help from a lot of people but I now have a better understanding of how to use JQuery and use Third-Party API's.
